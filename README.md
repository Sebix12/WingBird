GearBird can be your fullstack framework for building Web UIs.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is just an experiment project. Please, for the love of God and all Holy, don't use this in production. Batch - the language used in this language - is not capable for large scale applications. If you are interested in a framework for building a web app, check out React and JavaScript. Or check out PHP, the language that this framework transpiles/compiles into for backend.
